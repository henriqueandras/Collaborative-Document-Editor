- inserting not working versioning issue or retain not being moved
- ensure structure
- insert insert same position break ties
- deletion not working
- sequence of ops added (prev could affect new - test out)


Notes:
Version:[(a,1),(ab,2),(acb,3)
OpList:[(ins a,0,1),(ins b,1,2),(ins c,1,3)
Send:[(ins a,0,0),(ins c,1,2),
acbv


-----------------------
Version:[(b,1),(ab,2),(acb,3),
OpList:[(ins b,0,1),(ins a,0,2),(ins c,1,3)
Send:[(ins b,0,0),(ins v,3,3)

acbv



-maybe increment when adding
-





1)
OpList:[(ins a,0,1),(ins a,1,2),(ins b,2,3)]
Recieves: [(ins b,0,0),(ins b,1,1)]
aabb

2)
OpList:[(ins b,0,1),(ins b,1,2),(ins a,0,3)]
Receives:[(ins a,0,0),(ins a,1,1)]
aabb


1)
OpList:[(ins a,0,1),(ins a,)]
Receives:[(ins b,0,0)]
ab

2)


Whats not working:
1a2b1a2b in that order doesnt work. Log statements and find out why


1)
OpList:[(ins a,0,1),(ins b,1,2)]
Receives:[(ins b,0,0), (ins )]
ab


2)
OpList:[(ins b,0,1)]
Receives:[(ins a,0,0)]
ab

script: 1a2b1cc2dd

1)
OpList:[(ins a,0,1),(ins b,1,2),(ins d,2,3), (ins d,3,4), (ins c,4,5),(ins c,5,6)]
Receives:[(ins b,0,0),(ins c,2,3),(ins c,3,4)]
abddcc

2)
OpList:[(ins b,0,1),(ins a,0,2),(ins c,2,3), (ins c,3,4), (ins d,2,5),(ins d,3,6)]
Receives:[(ins a,0,0),(ins d,2,3),(ins d,3,4)]
abddcc


Reverse was happening bc of the prev from same client shifted right (increased retain) so 
new op would then not check compared to its prev operation



---------
Backend: Store a list of ops like prevTransformationList, and then operate like normal on frontend
but on the server side
